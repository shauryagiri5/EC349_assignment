# Introduction:

This project aims to use data from Yelp to robustly and accurately predict the amount of "stars" given by user *i* to business *j* in a review on the website. In order to do so, data into the users themselves and the characteristics of the reviews they post would intuitively prove to be valuable. Through the process of building this model, this intuition will be tested.

The Data Science Methodology used to engage with this project is the CRISP-DM (IBM, 2017) Framework (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining). The phased nature of this methodology provides a framework to turn this potentially convoluted project into an intuitive step-by-step procedure. Moreover, its cyclical nature allows for potential improvements to be iterated and evaluated rapidly, especially if it is applied loosely alongside principles of Agile. Given the unique nature of this project in its academic context, features such as the time-consuming and redundant documentation can be discarded to best fit the project's requirements. This ease and adaptability makes it effective for this project.

# Data Understanding:

Due to computational limits on the device used to complete this project, the large database with approximately 7 million reviews could not be used. Instead two smaller files entitled "yelp_review_small" and "yelp_user_small" were used in order to complete this project. As the names of these datasets imply, they contained data detailing reviews as well as the users.

The dataset "yelp_review_small" contains details of 1398056 reviews, including details such as the text of the review, the amount of stars it received, the opinions of other Yelpers etc. A comprehensive list of the variables and their explanations can be found in Table 1 of the appendix.

The dataset "yelp_user_small" contains details of 397579 users. Its key features include the number of reviews by a user, other users' opinions of their reviews, and their average star rating of their reviews, as Table 2 details.

The majority of the data included in these datasets is numeric. However, two variables are not directly numerical in nature. The first is the "text" variable. Since it is the text of the review, processes would have to quantify it. The second variable to consider is the target variable "stars" itself, as it can be a considered a categorical variable. However, unlike most categorical variables, each "category", or stars ranking, can be assigned a numerical value (for example, values of 0-5 for zero stars to 5 stars), thereby providing a logical reason to consider it a numeric variable.

# Data Exploration and Preparation:

Given that the majority of the variables available are numerical, in order to facilitate analysis, it may be worthwhile to consider converting the 'text' variable into a numeric measure. A simple numeric measure can be created simply by counting the number of words in the review text. However, this does not provide much insight into the character of the review. This can be achieved using the Bing Sentiment Lexicon, a dataset that categorises English words as either positive or negative (CRAN, 2004). This allows for a quantification of the nature of a text review, transforming the characters to a numeric variable, allowing for a numerical exploration of the relevant variables.

From Figure 1, it can be seen that "stars" does not follow a normal or a uniform distribution. There are significantly more 4 and 5 star reviews than 1, 2 or 3 star reviews.

From the correlation matrix in Table 3, it can be seen that there are variables across both datasets that have significant correlation coefficients with the target "stars" variable. These variables are "average_stars", "sentiment_score" and "text_count". This indicates that these variables may be useful in an attempt to model "stars".

# Modelling:

From the data exploration, it can be seen that "stars" is a a variable that may not be normally or uniformly distributed, and has correlation with a plethora of variables. Thus, in order to model for "stars", a modeling method that is versatile, adaptable and computationally exhaustive is a necessity.

Given the nature of the data and the computational power available, a tree regression emerges as a strong option. Given that the data is numerical, i.e. continuous, using a tree regression would allow for an intuitive solution. In order to mitigate potential overfitting, a pruning mechanism can be implemented, which can be tuned using a cross-validation function. After filtering a merged and processed dataset (removing null values, quantifying text etc), a sample of 100000 observations is taken. This sample is further split into a training dataset of 80000 and a testing dataset of 20000 observations. An implementation of this method can be seen in the decision tree depicted in Figure 2. In order to understand model validity and accuracy, the measures of r^2^ and Root Mean Standard Error (RMSE) are used. Through iteration and consideration of the correlation matrix, the optimum choice of variables is achieved.

# Model Evaluation:

The most efficient version of this model derived has an RMSE of 0.957 and an r^2^ of 0.578. These numbers imply that the model explains 57.8% of the variance in the true star ratings, based on the features extracted from the review and the user. These values also suggest that the model has avoided the typical tendency of tree regression over-fitting. The resultant decision tree also has significant insights. Whilst multiple variables such as 'useful.x' were included in the initial tree model code, their omission from the resultant decision tree demonstrates their limited "informativeness". This is in line with the weaker coefficient demonstrated by this variable. This points to a limit to the explanatory power of a model built only using user and review data.

In comparison, a traditional linear regression using the same variables has a RMSE of 1.03 and r^2^ of 0.513, thereby indicating a lower explanatory power with higher error for the linear regression. This does serve as a demonstration of the comparative merit of the tree regression model

# Conclusion:

Thus, it can be said that a tree regression can predict the majority of the amount of "stars" user *i* would award to business *j* on Yelp, with an error of less than a star using data on the review and characteristics of the review.

However, the fact that not all of the available variables in the Yelp dataset are suitably incorporated indicates that the explanatory power and robustness of this model could be improved. Potential improvements could include looking at the other associated datasets such as the business data.

The biggest challenge of the project was incorporating sentiment analysis from the review text. As the report demonstrates, the resultant variables have some of the most significant correlation coefficients. However, the process of integrating them was not simple as it required syntax and libraries from unfamiliar libraries in R. Other papers such as Rafay, Suleman and Alim (2020) create thier own dictionaries. This was unfeasible for this project. Thus, it involved a learning curve in order to create efficient code.
